# BasicAddonBuilder_LibreOffice 

## 0.6.0

`LibreOffice` extension for extension compiling  

Known instrument, fixed for `LO ver >= 7.3`.

Fixed adding toolbar buttons.

NOTE: add images only at toolbar creation step now.  
Adding images on menu's items creation step can up duplicate problem (todo).
