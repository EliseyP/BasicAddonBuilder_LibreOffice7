# BasicAddonBuilder_LibreOffice7 

## 0.6.5

`LibreOffice` extension for extension compiling  

Known instrument, fixed for `LO ver >= 7.1`.

Added Python Libraries support.  

Fixed adding toolbar buttons.

### Python Libraries support.

You can select directory with python modules.  
Extension's name must be set manually if only Python library selected (if both selected - Basic and Python - extension named from Basic library automatically).

Python modules and functions are available for mapping on toolbar or menu creation steps.


### TODO: 
- Create `Update.xml` file in extension creation dir.
- Optional removing version from extension name.
